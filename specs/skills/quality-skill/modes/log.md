# /quality Skill Modes Update Log

## 2026-06-23

- **Mode removal**: Removed the `wizard` mode spec from this folder for
  [0062 - Remove wizard mode](../../../../changes/0062-remove-wizard-mode.md).
  Bare and ambiguous `/quality` requests are now governed by the parent
  [`/quality` skill](../quality-skill.md) spec as read-only orientation, not as a
  public mode.

## 2026-06-22

- **Revision**: Updated the [`evaluate`](evaluate.md) mode spec for
  [0056 - Prospective evaluation plan artifacts](../../../../changes/archive/0056-prospective-evaluation-plan-artifacts.md)
  so `design.md` and the initial `plan.md` are authored before assessment
  evidence collection or record writes, later plan changes are explicit
  amendments, and `debug-log.md` remains process-only.

- **Mode removal**: Removed the `improve` mode spec from this folder. Applying or
  handing off evaluation recommendations is now governed by the non-mode
  [`recommendation follow-up`](../recommendation-follow-up.md) spec.

- **Creation**: Originally added behavioral component specs for the `/quality` runtime modes:
  [`setup`](setup.md), `wizard`, [`evaluate`](evaluate.md), `improve`, and
  [`update`](update.md). The parent
  [`/quality` skill](../quality-skill.md) spec keeps shared contracts and links
  to these mode-specific contracts.
