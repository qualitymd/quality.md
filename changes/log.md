# Changes Update Log

## 2026-06-17

- **Archival**: Retired the placeholder [0001 — Example change](archive/0001-example-change.md)
  into [`archive/`](archive/) now that the bundle has real changes to follow,
  keeping it as the reference template the
  [propose-a-change guide](../docs/guides/propose-a-change.md) points to. Set its
  status to `Done`, fixed the relative links for the deeper path, and updated the
  bundle [index](index.md) and the [archive index](archive/index.md).

- **Completion**: Implemented and archived
  [0002 — Specify the init command](archive/0002-init-command.md), adding
  `qualitymd init`, replacing the durable [`init` sub-spec](../specs/cli/init.md),
  and updating the README status.

- **Refinement**: Tightened change [0002 — Specify the init command](archive/0002-init-command.md)
  after review: framed implementation as the change's own **In-Progress** phase
  rather than deferred work, specified that a successful `init` writes its
  confirmation to standard error (keeping stdout clean for `-` piping), recorded
  the non-atomic `--force` overwrite as a [design](archive/0002-init-command/design.md)
  risk, and trimmed the `--json` note in the
  [functional spec](archive/0002-init-command/spec.md) to a pointer to the
  [CLI spec](../specs/cli.md) convention.

- **Design**: Advanced change [0002 — Specify the init command](archive/0002-init-command.md)
  from `Draft` to `Design` and added its [design doc](archive/0002-init-command/design.md):
  the scaffold ships as a static `//go:embed` asset (comments and body prose can't
  round-trip through YAML struct marshalling), overwrite protection rides on an
  atomic `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` open, and a conformance test runs the embedded skeleton
  through `spec.Load`. Updated the change [index](archive/0002-init-command/index.md).

- **Creation**: Added change [0002 — Specify the init command](archive/0002-init-command.md)
  (`status: Draft`) with its [functional spec](archive/0002-init-command/spec.md), settling
  the "To be specified" list on the [`init` sub-spec](../specs/cli/init.md): the
  scaffold contents (seeded rating scale, a commented target → factor → requirement
  skeleton, recommended body sections as headed stubs), the output target and
  stdout (`-`) piping, and `--force` overwrite protection. Records
  [`specs/cli/init.md`](../specs/cli/init.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md) as
  affected. Updated the bundle [index](index.md).

- **Process**: Defined the relationship between `changes/` and the enduring
  [`specs/`](../specs/index.md) bundle (replacing the "independent for now"
  note) — a change states a *delta* and is archived, while `specs/` and
  [`SPECIFICATION.md`](../SPECIFICATION.md) hold the *cumulative* source of
  truth. Added an **Affected specs & docs** section to the
  [Change concept](archive/0001-example-change.md) so each change records the durable
  specs and docs it creates or updates, brought into sync before `Done`.

## 2026-06-16

- **Initialization**: Created the `changes/` OKF bundle — a home for incremental
  work, independent of [`specs/`](../specs/index.md) for now. Added the bundle
  [index](index.md), [`schema.md`](schema.md) (`type: Schema`) registering the
  `Change`, `Functional Specification`, and `Design Doc` types, and an
  [`archive/`](archive/) folder for completed changes.
- **Creation**: Added a placeholder [Example change](archive/0001-example-change.md)
  (`status: Draft`) with child [spec](archive/0001-example-change/spec.md) and
  [design](archive/0001-example-change/design.md) concepts showing the intended shape.
